##7 Website Tips Every Independent Artist Needs To Know!

#1. Set Goals! 

A website is misguided and won’t communicate effectively if you don’t know your goals. Are you trying to drive more traffic, boost web sales, get noticed by major labels or compete with other artists? Make a list of what is most important to you and rank them to find out what you should be focusing on. Organization is key; your webpage should follow an intuitive thought process based on your goals. 

#2. Be the best version of YOU! 

Know who you are as an artist. What are you doing to make your fans true fans? Loyal fans will buy your product, attend your shows, and follow you as you grow. Make your fans comfortable. Webpage entertainment should relate to your fans in your own creative way.

Webpage visitors want to see what’s new and exciting! They also want to learn and educate themselves on who you are. Let them know where you came from and where you are going. Posting a blog or weekly Vlog (video blog) series is a great way to accomplish this. Entertainment equals trust, and trust equals sales. Instill trust in your fans, and they will reciprocate with loyalty. 

#3. Website  - Best practices

Create a responsive design and embrace new technology. A webpage should be compatible with all major devices such as phones, tablets, computers, etc. It should also work on all browsers including Safari, Google Chrome, and Firefox.  Also review features and functions of your website to ensure you’re using it to the best of its ability.

Create simple navigation. No one likes to spend time on a webpage to find what he or she is looking for. The visitor should intuitively know how to navigate the page before they even know what they’re trying to find. 

Create an easy and simple payment method, credit card and PayPal are the current standard. Add value when you can. For example, free shipping, extra merch/swag for larger orders, contests, etc. Make your fans feel like they’re getting a deal! 

#4. Inspire return visits!

Plumb your website to automatically feature new, exciting, unique content and product. Return webpage visitors are your most loyal fans and customers! Unique content is King (don’t copy other artist, be Innovadiv). Give them original music, news, merchandise, videos, and photos.

Update your website with new content on a daily basis. If you don’t have enough content to update daily then update weekly. Monitor your updates and posts by maintaining a task rotation schedule. Combine your website updates with your social media pages such as Innovadiv, Facebook, and Twitter. Using your website and social media pages together can be a powerful combination.  

These updates need to be exciting and engaging. Tell your fans about new songs, events, and show dates (become a resource). Promote service like songwriting, producing, and audio engineering. Artists are always looking to collaborate on projects. 

Promote beyond your website by taking advantage of outside sources. 

#5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Take advantage of analytics such as traffic sources. Be sure to use key words that work within your website, and localize. Have links to other websites that you work with. These sites can range from distributors, organizations, non-competing artists and more. Gathering data from your web traffic is a strong asset that you can use to your advantage. Find what works and stay the course. Find out what doesn’t work and fix it. 

#6. Copyrights, Contents

Unique content wins. Copied content with credit given to the original creator should be very scarce and only used when 100% necessary. New webpages without unique content are far less likely to succeed than those with unique content. Be the source of content, not the one relaying it. Also know when to copyright or take legal action to protect your content. 

#7. Key Idea

Know your space! Find your competitive advantage and exploit it! Understand other artists are competitors, not your enemies. Some of the greatest music stems from competition. Use that motivation to make great content.
